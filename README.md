# CppUtilities

https://JimFawcett.github.io/CppUtilities.html

Code, String, Test Utilities, and more
=================================================
These utilities are used in a lot of my code, which will appear in other repositories.
Many provide all their functionality in header files, but provide cpp files for demonstration.

Expected Changes
-----------------------------------------------
1. FileSystem and DirExplorers will be moved to their own repositories and removed
2. SingletonLogger will be redesigned
3. Construction tests - cpp mains in each of the Utility projects - will be redesigned
4. Regression tests - groups of tests that use a single-user test harness found in
   TestUtilities - will be added to most of the Utilities.
